Revolutionizing Recruitment: Enhanced Machine Learning Models for Bias Mitigation and Efficiency- RESEARCH PAPER FOR IBAC 2025 CONFERENCE PRESENTATION

Abstract

This study investigates the enhanced application of machine learning models to optimize recruitment processes by predicting hiring decisions based on comprehensive candidate profiles. Utilizing an expanded dataset of 1,500 candidates, the research incorporates diverse features such as age, gender, education level, work experience, skill scores, social media activity, and psychometric assessments. Several machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, and advanced ensemble methods (CatBoost, XGBoost), were evaluated to determine the best-performing model and identify the most influential features. Results show that CatBoost outperformed other models, achieving an accuracy of 95%, followed by Random Forest and XGBoost. Analysis of feature importance revealed that Recruitment Strategy, Education Level, and Personality Score were the top three factors influencing hiring decisions.
The study further enhances the model by implementing deep learning techniques and fairness-aware algorithms to mitigate biases. Bias detection and correction techniques, along with fairness metrics such as demographic parity and equal opportunity, were employed to ensure equitable hiring practices. Explainable AI methods, including SHAP and LIME, were incorporated to improve model interpretability for HR professionals. Additionally, the study explores the integration of ethical guidelines and data privacy measures to ensure transparency and accountability in AI-driven recruitment processes. These enhancements demonstrate the potential of machine learning to streamline recruitment, reduce biases, and improve hiring outcomes, promoting more efficient and equitable recruitment processes.
